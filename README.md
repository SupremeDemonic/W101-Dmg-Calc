CLI only Damage Calculator for Wizard101 - My First Upload


This is a command line interface only that lets you choose what to add by using the keys 1 - 7.

This is meant to be a faster way to calculate damage rather than use buttons or clicking around.

Create a file in the same directory called 'Wizard101 Spells History.txt'

At the top of the file, switch out the 250 with your own damage stats
