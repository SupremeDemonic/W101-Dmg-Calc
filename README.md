CLI only Damage Calculator for Wizard101 - My First Upload


This is a command line interface only that lets you choose what to add by using the keys 1 - 7.

This is meant to be a faster way to calculate damage rather than use buttons or clicking around.

Still working on calculating more than one blade and trap, if you have an idea let me know!

Create a file in the same directory called 'Wizard101 Spells History.txt'

At the top of the file, switch out the 250 with your own damage stats
